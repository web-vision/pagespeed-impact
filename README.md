# Web Accessibility Impact Calculator

## Overview
The loading speed of a website is not just a technical aspect, but has a direct impact on user experience, conversion rates and ultimately sales. At [web-vision.de](https://www.web-vision.de), we have developed the PageSpeed Impact Calculator to make these correlations tangible.

## Why is this important? 
A faster website not only improves the user experience, but can also significantly increase the conversion rate. According to studies, even small improvements in loading time can result in considerable increases in sales. With the PageSpeed Impact Calculator, companies can quantify this potential and make targeted investments in optimisation measures.

##  What is the PageSpeed Impact Calculator?
The PageSpeed Impact Calculator is a free online tool that makes it possible to calculate the potential economic benefit of an improved loading time for online shops. Based on recognised studies, such as the Google study for retail (8.4?% more conversion per 0.1?s faster loading time) and the Walmart analysis (+2?% conversion per 1?s faster loading time), users can run through individual scenarios.

## How It Works
The tool offers two input variants:

### Variant A Input Data
The calculator takes three key metrics:
1. Monthly Website Visitors
2. Average Order Value 
3. Total Order Value

### Variant B Input Data
The calculator takes three key metrics:
1. Monthly Website Visitors
2. Average Order Value 
3. Average Order Value

In addition, the current and target loading time of the website are entered in seconds. Using this data, the calculator calculates the current conversion rate, the average order value and predicts the potential increase in sales if the loading time is improved.
